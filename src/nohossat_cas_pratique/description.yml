description: This FastAPI application helps you infering, training and evaluating your sentiment analysis models. You can choose the text dataset of your choice and a SVM classifier or a LGBM model to perform sentiment analysis. The model chosen will be included in a pipeline which include a text cleaning step and a TF-IDF vectorizer. The API collects general classification metrics if needed with the integration of Neptune.ai library. For long-running models, you can choose to be notified when the training is over.
